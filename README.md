# 🧠 DevInsight — Internal Developer Productivity Portal (Emirates NBD)

### 🔹 Overview
**DevInsight** is an internal developer and QA productivity portal that I built during my time at **Emirates NBD**.  
It started as a personal side project to simplify daily development workflows but quickly gained recognition for its efficiency and usability — eventually being adopted across multiple teams within the bank.

The portal brings together a collection of tools, utilities, and APIs into a single, unified interface — helping engineers save hours every day by reducing context switching and dependency on external platforms.

- **Dynamic Data Exploration** with clickable tables, drill-down panels, and real-time API calls.  
- **Built-in Utilities** for API testing, encoding/decoding, diagramming, and environment navigation.  
- **Multi-entity Theming** to manage multiple environments seamlessly in a single pane.  
- Handles **800+ API calls per day**, significantly improving debugging speed and productivity.
